 Race tracker app
 ================
Race tracker app is an app I built to practice/experiment the skills I gained in `"Coroutines in Android"`
codelab. The app simulates race progress between two players.

In android apps, Coroutines help manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the 
main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive.

Through this app, I was able to learn:
 - Using coroutines in Android app lifecycle.
 - The principles of structured concurrency.
 - How to write unit tests to test the coroutines.
